# Zwoptex with cocos2d v3

This is a simple sample project showing command line integration with Zwoptex and cocos2d v3. 

## Requirements

* Xcode 6 Beta 3 or later
* Cocoapods

## Install

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the root folder in terminal and run `pod install`
3. Open the `zwoptex-cocos2d.xcworkspace`

## Setup

### Folders & Files

* `Assets` folder contains our sprite sheet assets
* `zwoptex-cocos2d` folder contains our project source code

### Command Line Integration

In the `Assets` folder you will find a `sprites.json` file and `sprites` folder. The `sprites.json` file is the command line configuration the project will use. If you open it up with any text editor you can follow through how itâ€™s setup. The general idea is to take the `sprites` folder and run them through Zwoptex when Xcode is building the project and output the resulting coordinates, textures and manifest file directly into the app that Xcode builds. You will see the `$(BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR)` and `$(SOURCE_ROOT)` environment variables that Xcode gives us being used to achieve this.

The advantage to outputing the final files directly into the built products directory is that a clean and build will ensure the sprite sheets are always re-generated.

### App Integration

Inside of the `AppDelegate.swift` is example of how to integrate the new manifest file Zwoptex provides for when you pack more than one sheet and also load them into the cocos2d sprite frame cache and place a sprite in the scene
